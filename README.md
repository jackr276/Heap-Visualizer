# Heap Visualizer
Author: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

This is a very simple project that contains an implemenation of a MinHeap, and a little algorithm that prints it out to the console like this:
```
Heap: [-1, 1, 0, 4, 7, 10, 2, 8, 7, 11, 9, 20, 15, 21, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

                                    -1
                 1--------------------------------------0
       4--------------------7                 10--------------------2
  8----------7         11----------9      20----------15         21----------5

```
